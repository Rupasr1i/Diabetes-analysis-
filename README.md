# Diabetes-analysis

**Introduction**

This readme document provides an overview of the project "Diabetes Patients," which was conducted using Power BI visualization tools. The project's primary focus was to analyze various factors affecting diabetes patients, including age, glucose level, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF), and skin thickness.

**Project Description**

The objective of this project was to gain insights into the relationships between the mentioned factors and the prevalence of diabetes among patients. Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, was used to create interactive and informative dashboards and reports to visualize the data effectively.

**Data Sources**

The data used in this project was collected from various sources, including medical records, surveys, and public health datasets. It encompasses a wide range of variables, with a focus on age, glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, blood pressure, DPF, and skin thickness, as these are known to be key determinants of diabetes.

**Findings**

**The project yielded the following key findings:**

**Age vs. Diabetes:** A visual analysis revealed that there's a higher likelihood of diabetes in older individuals.

**Glucose Levels and Diabetes:** Patients with higher glucose levels tend to have a higher risk of diabetes.

**BMI and Diabetes:** A positive correlation was observed between BMI and diabetes prevalence.

**Insulin Levels:** Patients with abnormally high or low insulin levels were more likely to have diabetes.

**Blood Pressure:** High blood pressure was associated with an increased risk of diabetes.

**Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF):** A higher DPF score appeared to be linked with a higher likelihood of diabetes.

**Skin Thickness:** Although not as prominent as other factors, skin thickness did show some influence on diabetes prevalence.

**Power BI Visualizations**

The project's visualizations were created using Power BI, offering interactive and easy-to-understand charts, graphs, and dashboards. Users can explore the data and relationships between variables to draw their own conclusions.

**Conclusion**

This project, "Diabetes Patients," explored the relationships between age, glucose level, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, DPF, and skin thickness in the context of diabetes. The Power BI visualizations provided a comprehensive understanding of how these factors interplay and influence the likelihood of diabetes among patients.

The insights gained from this project can be valuable for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers in developing strategies for diabetes prevention, early detection, and management.
